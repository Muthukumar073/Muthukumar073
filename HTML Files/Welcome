My First Project:-
I posted my first project: a static college website. 
It is the first project I have completed using HTML code.
I designed the website to provide comprehensive information about the college, including details about the courses offered and admission procedures. 
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of HTML and enhanced my web development skills. 
I am excited to continue learning and working on more advanced projects in the future.


My Second Project:-
I posted my second project, a static website about perfume, using HTML and CSS.
This project showcases various perfume brands, their unique fragrances, and detailed descriptions of each product.
It also includes a visually appealing layout and design elements to enhance the user experience.
Working on this project allowed me to improve my CSS skills and better understand the intricacies of web design.
I'm looking forward to tackling more complex projects and expanding my web development expertise.
