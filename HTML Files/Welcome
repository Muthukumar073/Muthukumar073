I posted my first project: a static college website. 
It is the first project I have completed using HTML code.
I designed the website to provide comprehensive information about the college, including details about the courses offered and admission procedures. 
This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of HTML and enhanced my web development skills. 
I am excited to continue learning and working on more advanced projects in the future.
